// Approach :

// if array_sum  is odd, then answer is false baecause it is not possible to divide an array into
// two subsets which give equal sum

// if we divide s into s1 and s2 : s1_sum == s2_sum == s_sum/2

// So our problem boils down to a problem of finding if there exists a subset with sum = s_sum/2
// which is the previous problem (11th)
