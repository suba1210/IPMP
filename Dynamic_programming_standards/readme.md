1. fibonacci sequence - memoization => top down approach
2. fibonacci sequence - tabulation => bottom up approach 
    Dimension of the table = number of parameters that are changing in the recursive solution.
    Size of the table = range of the parameters.
3. Longest Common Subsequence - recursive
4. Longest Common Subsequence - memoization
5. Longest Common Subsequence - tabulation
