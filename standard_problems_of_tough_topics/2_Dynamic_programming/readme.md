1. fibonacci sequence - memoization => top down approach
2. fibonacci sequence - tabulation => bottom up approach 
    Dimension of the table = number of parameters that are changing in the recursive solution.
    Size of the table = range of the parameters.
3. Longest Common Subsequence - recursive
4. Longest Common Subsequence - memoization
5. Longest Common Subsequence - tabulation
6. 0/1 Knapsack - recursion
7. 0/1 Knapsack - dp
8. Count combinations of coins giving the required sum - recursion
9. Count combinations of coins giving the required sum - dp
