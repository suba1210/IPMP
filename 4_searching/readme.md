# Searching

1. [Search in sorted rotated array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/)
2. [Find first and last positions of an element in a sorted array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-first-and-last-positions-of-an-element-in-a-sorted-array/)
3. Count number of occurences of a given number in a sorted array = first occurence index - last occurence index + 1
4. Given a sorted binary array, we need to count 1s in this array => size - first occurence of 1
5. [square root of a given number](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/square-root-of-an-integer/)
6. Majority element in any array - Moore's Voting algorithm, majority element in a sorted array => the middle element of the array.
7. [Floor and ceiling in a sorted array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ceiling-in-a-sorted-array/)
8. [Find the Minimum length Unsorted Subarray, sorting which makes the complete array sorted](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-length-unsorted-subarray-sorting-which-makes-the-complete-array-sorted/)
9. [Count number of occurrences (or frequency) in a sorted array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/count-number-of-occurrences-or-frequency-in-a-sorted-array/)
Approach : First do binary search and find the element, then traverse left side of it and right side of it to get its count.
10. [Find a Fixed Point (Value equal to index) in a given array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-fixed-point-in-a-given-array/)
11. [Find the maximum element in an array which is first increasing and then decreasing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-the-maximum-element-in-an-array-which-is-first-increasing-and-then-decreasing/)
12. Median of two sorted arrays of unequal sizes
13. [Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-minimum-element-in-a-sorted-and-rotated-array/)
14. [Search an element in a sorted and rotated array](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-an-element-in-a-sorted-and-pivoted-array/)
15. [Find position of an element in a sorted array of infinite numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-position-element-sorted-array-infinite-numbers/)
